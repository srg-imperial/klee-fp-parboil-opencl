I. Compilation

Call "make" in the appropriate source directory to a version of the benchmark.

Add "-D PROFILING" to enable profiling of kernel executions etc.
You may have to call "make --always-make" to ensure that all files are being re-compiled.


II. Running the Program

After compilation, the program binary can be found in the "bin" directory.
Depending on the version (CUDA or OpenCL), the binary is called "cp-cuda"
or "cp-opencl", respectively.

IIa. Command Line Parameters

There are three command line parameters controlling the overall program size:
    -volx   volume size in x-dimension (default: 512)
    -voly   volume size in y-dimension (default: 512)
    -atoms  number of atoms            (default: 40000)

To change the size of local workgroups, use the following parameters:
    -localx number of workitems in workgroup in x-dimension (default: 16)
    -localy number of workitems in workgroup in y-dimension (default:  8)
