I. Compilation

Call "make" in the appropriate source directory to a version of the benchmark.

Add "-D PROFILING" to enable profiling of kernel executions etc.
You may have to call "make --always-make" to ensure that all files are being re-compiled.


II. Running the Program

After compilation, the program binary can be found in the "bin" directory.
Depending on the version (CUDA or OpenCL), the binary is called "mri-fhd-cuda"
or "mri-fhd-opencl", respectively.

IIa. Command Line Parameters

There are two possible input sets: small and large.
They can be found in the inputs folder. Pass the appropriate file as the first
command line parameter.

Further command line parameters:
    -rhophi-local  threads per block for RhoPhi kernel (default: 512)
    -fh-local      threads per block for FH kernel     (default: 256)
    -numK          number of samples
    -numX          pixels in output
